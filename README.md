# DevCaft School Website Project

Welcome to the DevCaft School Website project repository! This project was developed by Team Error404 as part of the DevCaft competition, where we built a website for a government school. Our team is proud to have secured the second prize in this 7-day competition, competing against 50 other talented teams.
